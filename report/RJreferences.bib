 @article{Kochanski_2021, title={A Simulation Model for Risk and Pricing Competition in the Retail Lending Market}, volume={71}, ISSN={2464-7683}, DOI={10.32065/CJEF.2021.02.01}, abstractNote={We propose a simulation model of the retail lending market with two types of agents: borrowers searching for low interest rates and lenders competing through risk-based pricing. We show that individual banks observe adverse selection, even if every lender applies the same pricing strategy and a credit scoring model of comparable discrimination power. Additionally, the model justifies the reverse-S shape of the response rate curve. According to the model, the benefits of even small increases in the discrimination power of credit scoring are substantial. This effect is more pronounced if the number of offers checked by the applicants before making a decision increases. The simulations illustrate the trade-off between profitability, market share, and credit loss rates. The profit-maximising strategy is to set interest rates slightly lower than the competition; the excessive price reduction turns out to be counterproductive. At the same time, there exists a niche for higher yield players.}, number={2}, journal={Czech Journal of Economics and Finance}, author={Kochański, Blazej}, year={2021}, month=oct, pages={96–118}, language={en} }

 @article{Vargha_Delaney_2000, title={A Critique and Improvement of the “CL” Common Language Effect Size Statistics of McGraw and Wong}, volume={25}, ISSN={1076-9986}, DOI={10.2307/1165329}, abstractNote={McGraw and Wong (1992) described an appealing index of effect size, called “CL”, which measures the difference between two populations in terms of the probability that a score sampled at random from the first population will be greater than a score sampled at random from the second. McGraw and Wong introduced this “common language effect size statistic” for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized “CL” to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case. In the current paper a different generalization of “CL” called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations of “CL” are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics}, publisher={[American Educational Research Association, Sage Publications, Inc., American Statistical Association]}, author={Vargha, András and Delaney, Harold D.}, year={2000}, pages={101–132} }

 @article{Cliff_1993, address={US}, title={Dominance statistics: Ordinal analyses to answer ordinal questions}, volume={114}, ISSN={1939-1455}, DOI={10.1037/0033-2909.114.3.494}, abstractNote={Much behavioral research involves comparing the central tendencies of different groups, or of the same Ss under different conditions, and the usual analysis is some form of mean comparison. This article suggests that an ordinal statistic, d, is often more appropriate. d compares the number of times a score from one group or condition is higher than one from the other, compared with the reverse. Compared to mean comparisons, d is more robust and equally or more powerful; it is invariant under transformation; and it often conforms more closely to the experimeter’s research hypothesis. It is suggested that inferences from d be based on sample estimates of its variance rather than on the more traditional assumption of identical distributions. The statistic is extended to simple repeated measures designs, and ways of extending its use to more complex designs are suggested.

 @article{Idczak_2019, title={Remarks on Statistical Measures for Assessing Quality of Scoring Models}, volume={4}, rights={Copyright (c) 2019}, ISSN={2353-7663}, DOI={10.18778/0208-6018.343.02}, abstractNote={Granting a credit product has always been at the heart of banking. Simultaneously, banks are obligated to assess the borrower’s credit risk. Apart from creditworthiness, to grant a credit product, banks are using credit scoring more and more often. Scoring models, which are an essential part of credit scoring, are being developed in order to select those clients who will repay their debt. For lenders, high effectiveness of selection based on the scoring model is the primary attribute, so it is crucial to gauge its statistical quality. Several textbooks regarding assessing statistical quality of scoring models are available, there is however no full consistency between names and definitions of particular measures. In this article, the most common statistical measures for assessing quality of scoring models, such as the pseudo Gini index, Kolmogorov‑Smirnov statistic, and concentration curve are reviewed and their statistical characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, the author proposes the application of the well‑known distribution similarity index as a measure of discriminatory power of scoring models. The author also attempts to standardise names and formulas for particular measures in order to finally contrast them in a comparative analysis of credit scoring models.}, number={343343}, journal={Acta Universitatis Lodziensis.
