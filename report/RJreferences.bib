 @article{Kochanski_2021, title={A Simulation Model for Risk and Pricing Competition in the Retail Lending Market}, volume={71}, ISSN={2464-7683}, DOI={10.32065/CJEF.2021.02.01}, abstractNote={We propose a simulation model of the retail lending market with two types of agents: borrowers searching for low interest rates and lenders competing through risk-based pricing. We show that individual banks observe adverse selection, even if every lender applies the same pricing strategy and a credit scoring model of comparable discrimination power. Additionally, the model justifies the reverse-S shape of the response rate curve. According to the model, the benefits of even small increases in the discrimination power of credit scoring are substantial. This effect is more pronounced if the number of offers checked by the applicants before making a decision increases. The simulations illustrate the trade-off between profitability, market share, and credit loss rates. The profit-maximising strategy is to set interest rates slightly lower than the competition; the excessive price reduction turns out to be counterproductive. At the same time, there exists a niche for higher yield players.}, number={2}, journal={Czech Journal of Economics and Finance}, author={Kochański, Blazej}, year={2021}, month=oct, pages={96–118}, language={en} }

 @article{Vargha_Delaney_2000, title={A Critique and Improvement of the “CL” Common Language Effect Size Statistics of McGraw and Wong}, volume={25}, ISSN={1076-9986}, DOI={10.2307/1165329}, abstractNote={McGraw and Wong (1992) described an appealing index of effect size, called “CL”, which measures the difference between two populations in terms of the probability that a score sampled at random from the first population will be greater than a score sampled at random from the second. McGraw and Wong introduced this “common language effect size statistic” for normal distributions and then proposed an approximate estimation for any continuous distribution. In addition, they generalized “CL” to the n-group case, the correlated samples case, and the discrete values case. In the current paper a different generalization of “CL” called the A measure of stochastic superiority, is proposed, which may be directly applied for any discrete or continuous variable that is at least ordinally scaled. Exact methods for point and interval estimation as well as the significance tests of the A = .5 hypothesis are provided. New generalizations of “CL” are provided for the multi-group and correlated samples cases.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics}, publisher={[American Educational Research Association, Sage Publications, Inc., American Statistical Association]}, author={Vargha, András and Delaney, Harold D.}, year={2000}, pages={101–132} }

This article suggests that an ordinal statistic, d, is often more appropriate. d compares the number of times a score from one group or condition is higher than one from the other, compared with the reverse. Compared to mean comparisons, d is more robust and equally or more powerful; it is invariant under transformation; and it often conforms more closely to the experimeter’s research hypothesis. It is suggested that inferences from d be based on sample estimates of its variance rather than on the more traditional assumption of identical distributions. The statistic is extended to simple repeated measures designs, and ways of extending its use to more complex designs are suggested.

Simultaneously, banks are obligated to assess the borrower’s credit risk. Apart from creditworthiness, to grant a credit product, banks are using credit scoring more and more often. Scoring models, which are an essential part of credit scoring, are being developed in order to select those clients who will repay their debt. For lenders, high effectiveness of selection based on the scoring model is the primary attribute, so it is crucial to gauge its statistical quality. Several textbooks regarding assessing statistical quality of scoring models are available, there is however no full consistency between names and definitions of particular measures. In this article, the most common statistical measures for assessing quality of scoring models, such as the pseudo Gini index, Kolmogorov‑Smirnov statistic, and concentration curve are reviewed and their statistical characteristics are discussed. Furthermore, the author proposes the application of the well‑known distribution similarity index as a measure of discriminatory power of scoring models. The author also attempts to standardise names and formulas for particular measures in order to finally contrast them in a comparative analysis of credit scoring models.}, number={343343}, journal={Acta Universitatis Lodziensis.

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.}, number={1}, journal={Radiology}, publisher={Radiological Society of North America}, author={Hanley, J A and McNeil, B J}, year={1982}, month=apr, pages={29–36} }

In this article we analyze the Cumulative Accuracy Proﬁle (CAP) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) which are both commonly used in practice. We give a test-theoretic interpretation for the concavity of the CAP and the ROC curve and demonstrate how this observation can be used for more efﬁciently exploiting the informational contents of accounting ratios. Furthermore, we show that two popular summary statistics of these concepts, namely the Accuracy Ratio and the area under the ROC curve, contain the same information and we analyse the statistical properties of these measures. We show in detail how to identify accounting ratios with high discriminative power, how to calculate conﬁdence intervals for the area below the ROC curve, and how to test if two rating models validated on the same data set are different. All concepts are illustrated by applications to real data.}, journal={SSRN Electronic Journal}, author={Engelmann, Bernd and Hayden, Evelyn and Tasche, Dirk}, year={2003}, language={en} }

This article reviews the uses of three such parameters, namely Kendall’s τa, Somers’ D and the Hodges-Lehmann median diﬀerence. Conﬁdence intervals for these are demonstrated using the somersd package. It is argued that conﬁdence limits for these parameters, and their diﬀerences, are more informative than the traditional practice of reporting only P -values. These three parameters are also important in deﬁning other tests and parameters, such as the Wilcoxon test, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Harrell’s C, and the Theil median slope.}, number={1}, journal={The Stata Journal: Promoting communications on statistics and Stata}, author={Newson, Roger}, year={2002}, month=mar, pages={45–64}, language={en} }

 @article{Austin_Steyerberg_2012, title={Interpreting the concordance statistic of a logistic regression model: relation to the variance and odds ratio of a continuous explanatory variable}, volume={12}, rights={http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0}, ISSN={1471-2288}, DOI={10.1186/1471-2288-12-82}, abstractNote={Background: When outcomes are binary, the c-statistic (equivalent to the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a standard measure of the predictive accuracy of a logistic regression model.
Methods: An analytical expression was derived under the assumption that a continuous explanatory variable follows a normal distribution in those with and without the condition. We then conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine whether the expressions derived under the assumption of binormality allowed for accurate prediction of the empirical c-statistic when the explanatory variable followed a normal distribution in the combined sample of those with and without the condition. We also examine the accuracy of the predicted cstatistic when the explanatory variable followed a gamma, log-normal or uniform distribution in combined sample of those with and without the condition.
Results: Under the assumption of binormality with equality of variances, the c-statistic follows a standard normal cumulative distribution function with dependence on the product of the standard deviation of the normal components (reflecting more heterogeneity) and the log-odds ratio (reflecting larger effects). Under the assumption of binormality with unequal variances, the c-statistic follows a standard normal cumulative distribution function with dependence on the standardized difference of the explanatory variable in those with and without the condition. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we found that these expressions allowed for reasonably accurate prediction of the empirical c-statistic when the distribution of the explanatory variable was normal, gamma, log-normal, and uniform in the entire sample of those with and without the condition.
Conclusions: The discriminative ability of a continuous explanatory variable cannot be judged by its odds ratio alone, but always needs to be considered in relation to the heterogeneity of the population.}, number={1}, journal={BMC Medical Research Methodology}, author={Austin, Peter C and Steyerberg, Ewout W}, year={2012}, month=dec, pages={82}, language={en} }
